　　先说“虎穴仙女”。关系到纳摩格尔底寺名字的由来。“纳摩”，藏语译音，意为“仙女”。甘肃一方用汉字表示为“郎木”。小镇的全称应为“达仓纳摩”，就是“虎穴仙女”。传说很久以前，纳摩大峡谷有一头白额大虎常从森林里出来伤害生灵。这里的人死的死逃的逃，非常凄惨。一天，当恶虎正在穷追来不及逃散的人时，空中飘来仙女华尔旦纳摩，用智慧降伏了恶虎，并把它关在了石穴中，让它日夜守护在白龙江的源头。然而，华尔旦纳摩则因私自下凡回不了天庭，无奈只好住进了岩洞。
不怕流光简单把人抛，只在意红的樱桃，绿的芭蕉，滋味可好。
　　其次就是作者写的对象是“天下第一”的“景”，这些“天下第一”的城、关、楼、山、塔、泉、亭……等等，既然可以称为“天下第一”，也就必然有着悠远的历史文化背景，有着一些独特的有一定影响力的或民间或神话或远古留下的种种传说，有着其或悲或喜或曲或折的成百上千年的沧桑历程。大家完全可以想象，其实这每一个“天下第一”的“景”，其所包容的内涵都是足以写成一本书的。也就是说，《天下第一景》这本书中所收录的52个天下第一，如果仔细考究琢磨起来，再适当伸延扩展一下的话，就完全可以写成52本各具特色而异彩纷呈的书。然而，作者却仅用了短短几千字就道出了这一个个天下第一“景”的各自最为突出的特点，并以简洁明快、流畅优美的笔触，通过自己的亲身经历和感受为线索，融入了自己对这一个个“景”的感悟和理解，生动而真切地表达出了作者对祖国大好河山的赞美与热爱。
